# Visual Studio Code (Mac OS & Windows) - Setting up a Python Development Environment and Complete Overview

These are the files created while following tutorials, by Corey Schafer, on how to set up VS Code for Mac OS and Windows respectively. Links to the tutorials:
   - [Visual Studio Code (Mac)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06I63_p-2A4)
   - [Visual Studio Code (Windows)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nh9rCzPJ20&t=1589s)

# File Structure
   - Start by opening the [vscode_notes](https://github.com/erikamart/vsCodeSetup/blob/master/vscode_notes) file that holds all the minute by minute notes taken during the Mac tutorial.
   - At "min 1:02:37", in the "vscode_notes" file, it gives directions where to find the "Python-Unit-Testing" folder within Coreys page to continue within the tutorial. If you don't want to go through that process, I have extracted and created a repo just for this purpose here in my github. Clone my repo here --> [Python-Unit-Testing](https://github.com/erikamart/Python-Unit-Testing)
   - [macScript.py](https://github.com/erikamart/vsCodeSetup/blob/master/macScript.py) is the code made during the Mac tutorial.
   - All other .py files are from the Windows tutorial.
