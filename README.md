These are the files created while following tutorials, by Corey Schafer, on how to set up VS Code for Mac OS and Windows respectively. Links to the tutorials:

# File Structure
   - Start by opening the [vscode_notes](https://github.com/erikamart/vsCodeSetup/blob/master/vscode_notes) file that holds all the minute by minute notes taken during the Mac tutorial.
   - At "min 1:02:37", in the "vscode_notes" file, it gives directions where to find the "Python-Unit-Testing" folder within Coreys page to continue within the tutorial. If you don't want to go through that process, I have extracted and created a repo just for this purpose here in my github. Clone my repo here --> [Python-Unit-Testing](https://github.com/erikamart/Python-Unit-Testing)
   - [macScript.py](https://github.com/erikamart/vsCodeSetup/blob/master/macScript.py) is the code made during the Mac tutorial.
   - All other .py files are from the Windows tutorial.
